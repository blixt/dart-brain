Dart Brain
==========

An input/output AI model written in Dart.


Getting started
---------------

First of all, you need the Dart SDK. I suggest just [downloading and installing *DartEditor*][dartedit], which includes
everything you need.

Then, clone this repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/blixt/dart-brain.git

Now open the `dart-brain` directory in *DartEditor*.

Finally, select *Tools* > *Pub Install* to create the `packages` directories needed to be able to run the app.

To run the code in the browser, right click `main.html` and choose *Run in Dartium*.
